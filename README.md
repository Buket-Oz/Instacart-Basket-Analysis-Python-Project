# Instacart Sales Analysis Project

## Objective
This project analyzes sales data from Instacart to derive insights into customer purchasing behaviors and sales patterns. The analysis aims to inform targeted marketing strategies, helping Instacart enhance segmentation and improve advertising efficacy.

## Key Questions
- **What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?** 
- **At what times of the day do people tend to spend the most money?** 
- **How can simple price range groupings be used to optimize marketing and sales efforts?** 
- **Which types of products are most popular?** 
- **What are the characteristics of different customer profiles in the system?** This includes:
  - Brand loyalty.
  - Ordering habits based on loyalty status.
  - Regional differences in ordering habits.
  - Connections between demographic factors (age, family status) and ordering patterns.
  - Influence of demographic information (age, income, types of goods, family status) on purchasing behavior.
  - Differences in the ordering habits of various customer profiles.

These questions are designed to dissect the complex consumer behavior within Instacart's shopping environment, providing targeted insights for strategic marketing planning.

## Data
This project uses several open-source data sets from Instacart alongside a specially created customer data set. The data includes customers, orders, products, and departments. Due to size constraints, the data files are not uploaded to GitHub but are available upon request.

### Data Sets:
- **Customers**: Analyzed for purchasing patterns and loyalty.
- **Orders**: Studied to determine busy times and spending habits.
- **Products**: Categorized to understand popularity and sales impact.
- **Departments**: Analyzed for sales volume per department.
